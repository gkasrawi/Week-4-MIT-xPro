//  The forEach method Performs the specified action for each element in an array.
console.log('foreach');
words.forEach(word) => console.log(word));
// another way to iterate through every element inside the array. 
// so you say name of array words for each and 'forEach' method takes a callback function and for each word we're just console logging the word.
=> console.log(word)
// That is known as an arrow function, so this actually a function and for each word inside the array we're running the function.
