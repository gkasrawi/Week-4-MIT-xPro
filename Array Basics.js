// Array Manipulation
// An Array is an ordered collection of data(either primitive or object depending upon the language). Compared with variable that can add only one value.
// arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.  
const words = ['I', 'love', 'pizza']   
console.log(words);
console.log(words[0]); // I
console.log(words.length);  //3 method expression
//  Above shown the .length method which retrieves and identifies the length of the array. 
//  This is a number one higher than the highest index in the array.
